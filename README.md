One day I made a few CSEs for my own needs, and understood that they could be useful for others, especially in Central Asia and Russian-speaking areas. Then I added to my list some CSEs by [CyberYozh](https://cyberyozh.com/), [cipher387](https://github.com/cipher387/pastebinsearchengines), [OSINT ME](https://www.osintme.com/index.php/2020/09/28/using-the-google-custom-search-engine-for-osint/) and [cqcore](https://github.com/The-Osint-Toolbox/Custom-Search-Engines), and more, and more; see the list below. All these CSE's are manually tested and work well. If not, please, open an issue. Feel free to add PR if you created your own CSE or discovered useful CSE that is not in the list.
